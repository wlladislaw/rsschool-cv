### About me

I've been into web development for over a year. At first I studied Java, but later I realized that I wanted to work with the visual component and chose Javascript.
I worked as a technical administrator and at the same time helped a friend with his site for selling of handmade bracelets.
I decided to spend all the time on development and took courses at the developers bootcamp.

Now I am improving my acquired knowledge.
I really need in activity where I can develop during my life, that's why I'm interested in frontend.

I can be helpful in quickly solving various problems, as well as when
need to find a non-obvious solution.
I'm looking for patterns, scientific explanations in everything,what surrounds us. Always focused on results. Like STEM, american football and any outdoor activities.
